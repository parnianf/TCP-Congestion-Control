# TCP-Congestion-Control
The aim of this project is to get acquainted with the function of `TCP` and to implement the mechanism of sending correct information along with **congestion control** using `UDP` sockets in the network.

## Go Back N Protocol(GBN)
Go-Back-N ARQ is a specific instance of the automatic repeat request (ARQ)
protocol, in which the sending process continues to send a number of frames
specified by a window size even without receiving an acknowledgment (ACK)
packet from the receiver.


## Selective Repeat Protocol(SR)
Selective repeat protocol, also called Selective Repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat request), is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method for
the reliable delivery of data frames. Here, only the erroneous or lost frames are
retransmitted, while the good frames are received and buffered.
